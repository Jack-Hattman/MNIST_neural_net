This is just a simple implementation of a Neural Network for fun

features:
 - Adam Optimizer
 - Visualization with Matplotlib
 - Saving and Loading Models with pickle
 - Dynamic struction (you can change the number of neurons per layer and the number of layers)

TODO:
 - Add more preprocessing to the user image (its pretty bad rn)
